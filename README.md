# Intro

Implementation of Conway Game of Life. I also want to create a network that can learn Game of life rule.

If you don't know about it yet, you can read these articles:
+ In vietnamese: https://thefullsnack.com/posts/game-of-life.html
+ In English: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

I think that I will write some articles after finishing the code. Maybe it should be 2 parts series. Hope so!

=================================

# Log:

+ 18 Sep: created
+ 27 Sep: created some main files. Still not figure out how to code it yet. Should write out the flow and coding next week.
+ 28 Sep: finished the calculation part. Much easier than my thought. It can calculate a state of [1280, 1280] field in 0.09s, I think that it is quite fast. Will implement the visualize part later. And write some test cases.
